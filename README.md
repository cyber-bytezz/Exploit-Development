## Overview

The Fuzzer is a Python script designed to perform basic fuzzing on a target system. It sends a sequence of "A" characters as a payload to test the system's response and identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Key Features

- Basic fuzzer implementation
- Customizable payload generation
- Socket-based communication with the target system
- Automatic payload size increment
- Crash detection and reporting

## Usage

1. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/cyber-bytezz/fuzzer.git`
3. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4. Customize the target IP address and port in the `connect()` method of the script.
5. Run the script: `python fuzzer.py`
6. Observe the script's output for potential crashes.

## Happy Hacking
